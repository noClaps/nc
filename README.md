# NC

This is a language that I'm working on. It takes inspiration from multiple languages like Python, JavaScript, Swift, C, Go, Rust, Julia, etc., and basically combines the parts I liked most about them into one thing.

As of now, I don't plan on using the language for anything more than basic scripting. I might extend the compiler to compile to other languages, as well as create more libraries to extend functionality, but I want the language itself to be simple.

The language design is documented [here](./docs/design.md).
